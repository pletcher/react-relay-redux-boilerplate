React/Relay/Redux Boilerplate
---

# Rationale

This repo mostly serves as documentation of my current foray into React/Relay with Redux to manage local state. It doesn't do much at the moment â€” it just provides the necessary setup for creating/updating basic user accounts. I'll continue to update it as I get a better sense of what (not) to do with this setup.

It goes without saying, but all of the dependencies are the sole intellectual property of their (awesome) creators.

# Highlights

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react): Components!
- [Relay](https://github.com/facebook/relay): Colocation (etc.)!
- [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux): Local state!
- [React Relay Router](https://github.com/relay-tools/react-router-relay): Based on the awesome [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack): I'd love to get [hot module reloading](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) working again.

Also, [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/) is the honest-to-goodness shit.

# Can I use it?

Sure, but it's not production-ready. You'll need to update `index.js` and `webpack.config.js` according to your production needs. (I'm working on figuring out what _my_ production needs are, and will update those files accordingly once I have some idea.)

Just fork and run the following and you should be good to go:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:[YOUR_USERNAME]/react-relay-redux-boilerplate.git
$ cd react-relay-redux-boilerplate
$ npm install
$ npm run db:migrate
$ npm test # only if you really want to
$ npm run dev
```
